Cricket Database Management System
This project is a comprehensive Database Management System (DBMS) designed to efficiently manage, store, and analyze cricket match data. Developed as part of an academic course, the system models real-world cricket tournaments and provides a robust platform for tracking teams, players, matches, scores, and statistics.

Project Overview:-
The Cricket DBMS project aims to centralize and organize all essential information related to cricket tournaments, including details about teams, players, coaches, umpires, and match outcomes. The database is structured to support efficient querying and reporting, enabling users to retrieve insights such as top performers, match results, player statistics, and historical records.

Key Features:-
Comprehensive Data Modeling: Captures entities such as teams, players, matches, scores, coaches, and umpires, with relationships reflecting real-world cricket scenarios.
Efficient Querying: Supports complex queries to retrieve information like highest scorers, best bowlers, man of the match, team rankings, and historical performance.
Normalization and Integrity: The database is designed in BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form) to eliminate redundancy and maintain data integrity.
User-Friendly Structure: Enables broadcasters, analysts, and cricket enthusiasts to quickly access relevant statistics and match details.
Extensible Design: Can be adapted for use in various contexts, from international tournaments to college-level cricket events.

Files Included:-
DatabaseCreation.sql: Scripts to create all tables and relationships.
ValuesInsertion.sql: Sample data for teams, players, matches, and more.
SampleQueries.sql: Example queries demonstrating how to extract meaningful insights.
ViewsForEntitiesAndRelations.sql: Predefined views for simplified data access.
Documentation.pdf: Comprehensive project documentation detailing the database design, ER diagrams, normalization steps, sample queries, and analysis.

How to Use:-
Import the SQL scripts into your preferred RDBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Use the provided sample data for testing and demonstration.
Run the sample queries to explore player stats, match outcomes, and team performance.
Refer to the attached PDF documentation for a detailed explanation of the database structure, design decisions, and usage examples.
Extend the database with additional data or queries as needed.

Learning Outcomes:-
Gained practical experience in relational database design and normalization.
Developed SQL skills for data definition, manipulation, and analytical querying.
Learned to model complex, real-world systems in a scalable and maintainable way.
Enhanced ability to document and communicate technical solutions effectively.

Applications:-
This Cricket Database Management System is valuable for broadcasters, analysts, researchers, and cricket fans seeking quick access to structured cricket statistics and insights. It serves as a foundation for further development of cricket analytics tools, web applications, or performance tracking systems.
