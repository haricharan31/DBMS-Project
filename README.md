Cricket Match Database Management System
This project is a comprehensive Database Management System (DBMS) designed as part of my academic coursework to model, store, and analyze data related to cricket matches. The system demonstrates practical application of database concepts such as relational schema design, normalization, and complex SQL querying.

The database is structured to capture all essential aspects of cricket matches, including teams, players, scores, and match statistics. It allows users to insert, update, and retrieve detailed information about matches and participants, making it useful for sports analytics, record-keeping, and as a foundation for further cricket management applications.

Key Features:

Well-structured relational schema: The database is normalized for efficiency and covers entities such as teams, players, matches, and scores.

SQL scripts for database creation and data insertion: Includes scripts to set up the database, insert sample data, and demonstrate typical operations.

Sample queries and views: Provides example queries for extracting player statistics, match summaries, and team performance analytics.

Data integrity and consistency: Utilizes primary and foreign keys to maintain data relationships and ensure consistency across tables.

Learning Outcomes:

Gained hands-on experience in designing and implementing relational databases.

Developed skills in SQL for data definition, manipulation, and advanced querying.

Practiced organizing real-world data into a scalable and maintainable database structure.

This project not only strengthened my understanding of DBMS principles but also gave me practical exposure to solving real-world data management problems using SQL and relational databases.
